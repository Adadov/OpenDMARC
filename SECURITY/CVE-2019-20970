CVE-2019-20790 - OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x, when used with 
pypolicyd-spf 2.0.2, allows attacks that bypass SPF and DMARC 
authentication in situations where the HELO field is inconsistent 
with the MAIL FROM field.

Details: While the SPF RFC (RFC7208) says that entities MUST check 
the "Mail From" header during an SPF check (RFC7208 section 2.4).  

Section 2.3 says and that checking the HELO/EHLO string is RECOMMENDED.  

It further states (section 2.3): 

If a conclusive determination about the message can be made based on 
a check of "HELO", then the use of DNS resources to process the typically 
more complex "MAIL FROM" can be avoided.

The OpenDMARC Authors formally suggest that whomever wrote that section 
was smoking something that's only recently legal in Oregon.

The HELO string is trivially forgeable and can be set to any value by 
anyone delivering mail to a system.  It does not depend on the hostname 
of the transmitting system.

Resolution/Workaround: It is the job of OpenDMARC to trust information 
provided to it by upstream filters.   OpenDMARC itself can be configured 
to validate SPF, but there are use-cases where OpenDMARC may be running 
further inside a network and not have access to the connection strings as 
logged.

It is the view of the OpenDMARC developers that this is working as 
designed, but if this behavior is undesirable, then any filter which adds 
a received-spf header should not set a spf=pass result based solely on the 
HELO/EHLO string.  It is not the job of OpenDMARC to second-guess other 
filters in the chain, but simply to compare their stated values and make 
a weight-based judgement.
