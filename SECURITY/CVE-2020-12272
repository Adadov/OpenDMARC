CVE-2020-12272 - OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks
that inject authentication results to provide false information 
about the domain that originated an e-mail message. This is caused
by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM authentication 
results, as demonstrated by the example.net(.example.com substring.

Resolution: OpenDMARC has added checking to validate that the domain
element in both SPF and DKIM headers being inspected argument contains 
only valid domain name characters.  This has been fixed as of
OpenDMARC 1.4.1 (March 2021).  While not mentioned in the CVE, fixes 
are in a soon-to-be released branch of OpenDKIM as well to not put such a 
malformed header in place.
